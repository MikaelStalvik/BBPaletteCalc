# Bitbendaz Atari STe palette and raster toolkit
Calculate AtariSte palettes, tweak palettes, export palettes to Motorola 68000 assembler code, create fades and generate gradients/rasters.
This is the ultimate tool to tweak palette data from Degas PI1 files.

Warning, this is an early alpha version, most likely containing issues and ugly UI :)

**Work in progress!**
